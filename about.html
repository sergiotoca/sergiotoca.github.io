                    <h2>Passionate about Technology</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Sergio Toledo, a Georgian College Computer Programming student with over 6 years of experience in logistics operations and production management. I also hold a Bachelor's Degree in Control and Automation Engineering, which has sharpened my proactive problem-solving skills.</p>
                    <p>I've always been passionate about technology and how it can improve our way of living, from solving daily problems to advancing rocket science. That's why I dedicated my studies and career to this field. My experience in managing production and product engineering departments at WDC Networks, a company that distributes and manufactures high-level technology products, has allowed me to hone my leadership and coaching skills. I've learned firsthand that developing competencies in subordinates has a direct effect on developing the whole team.</p>

                <h2>Recent Accomplishments</h2>
                <p>Since moving to Toronto in August of last year, I've been fully immersed into coding, where I'm currently in my third term of the Computer Programming program. I've had the opportunity to complete a variety of courses, including web programming using PHP, object-oriented programming using Java, interface design using CSS, and document automation using Python. These courses have equipped me with essential technical skills and knowledge, which I'm eager to apply as I continue exploring different programming languages and technologies.</p>
                <p>Living in Toronto has been an enriching experience, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to study and live in this vibrant city. As I progress through my studies and gain more hands-on experience, I'm excited to contribute to the tech industry and make a meaningful impact.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website. If you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration, please don't hesitate to get in touch.</p>
