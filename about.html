                    <h2>Passionate about Technology</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Sergio Toledo, an aspiring Full-Stack Developer and Data Process Analyst set to graduate from Georgian College's Computer Programming program in the summer of 2024. My journey in technology is supported by a foundational Bachelor's Degree in Control and Automation Engineering and enriched by over six years of professional experience in logistics operations and production management.</p>
                    <p>Fascinated by the interface of technology and practical processes, I've transitioned from a production management role where I mastered the intricacies of industrial workflow, to diving deep into coding and software development. This pivot was inspired by a vision to craft software solutions that elevate operational efficiency and drive innovation.</p>

                <h2>Recent Accomplishments</h2>
                <p>During an immersive 8-month internship with Ontario Power Generation, I developed web applications and data analytics tools that revolutionized business process monitoring and management. I led the Project Charter for a multi-million dollar renovation project, automated key operational reminders with Python, and deployed Power BI dashboards to transform data into actionable insights.</p>
                <p>I'm eager to apply my blend of engineering insight, managerial experience, and technical acumen to full-stack development and data-driven projects. As I anticipate my graduation, I am looking for opportunities to bring my unique perspective to forward-thinking teams that value innovative solutions and relentless improvement.</p>
                <p>Toronto has been the backdrop for this exciting chapter in my educational and professional growth. It's here that I've honed my skills in web programming with PHP, Java, CSS, and document automation, and where I've cultivated a commitment to technology that makes a tangible difference.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. For inquiries or collaboration opportunities, feel free to connect.</p>
